## 🌌 The Vision
Modern finance moves at the speed of algorithms, yet analysts are often bogged down by manual data entry and static modeling. Apex Capital AI transitions the research process from a "search-and-summarize" workflow to an "autonomous reasoning" engine.

## 🛠 Features

### 1. Multi-Agent Reasoning Pipeline
The terminal utilizes a hierarchy of specialized sub-agents to process any ticker or URL:
- **🕵️ SCOUT:** Performs deep-web harvesting and regulatory filing extraction via Google Search Grounding.
- **📊 ANALYST:** Normalizes financials and executes 3-statement modeling.
- **🛡️ ASSOCIATE:** Performs forensic accounting, moat analysis, and risk assessment.
- **👔 VP:** Stress-tests LBO feasibility and relative valuation comps.
- **🏛️ PM (Portfolio Manager):** Synthesizes the "Variant Perception" and final Investment Thesis.

### 2. Forensic & Alternative Alpha
- **Earnings "Lie Detector":** Quantifies management sentiment shift by analyzing "hesitation words" vs. "confidence words" across quarters.
- **Vibecode Sensitivity:** Evaluates the risk of a legacy business being "culturally obsoleted" by rapid AI shifts.
- **Digital Footprint:** Integrates alternative data proxies like web traffic, app downloads, and search trends.
- **Whale Watching:** Tracks institutional crowdedness and "Smart Money" flow.

### 3. Institutional Modeling Suite
- **Interactive DCF:** Full Perpetuity Growth model with built-in sensitivity matrices (WACC vs. g).
- **LBO Analysis:** Feasibility scanner for private equity scenarios including IRR and MoC projections.
- **Supply Chain Mapping:** Visualizes the network graph of suppliers and customers to identify systemic risks.

### 4. Generative Reporting
- **Insight Synthesis:** Automatically generates professional-grade Equity Research Memos.
- **Visual Metaphors:** Uses Gemini's multimodal capabilities to generate AI-driven visual representations of a company's strategic future.

## 🚀 Technical Architecture
- **Engine:** Google Gemini 3 Pro (Reasoning) & Gemini 2.5 Flash (Scouting & Image Gen).
- **Frontend:** React 19 + Tailwind CSS (Cyberpunk UI/UX).
- **Data:** Real-time search grounding and simulated market ticks.
