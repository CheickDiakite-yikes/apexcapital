## 🌌 The Vision
Wall Street is shifting from "Information Arbitrage" to "Cognitive Arbitrage." Apex Capital AI replaces the static analyst workflow with a dynamic, sovereign intelligence that doesn't just read data—it *reasons* about it.

## 🧠 Cognitive Architecture (The "Brain")
The terminal operates via a coordinated swarm of specialized sub-agents:
- **🕵️ SCOUT (Intelligence):** Deep-web harvesting, EDGAR filing extraction, and supply chain mapping.
- **📊 ANALYST (Reconstruction):** Builds full 15+ line-item 3-statement models (Income, Balance, Cash Flow) from raw unstructured data.
- **🛡️ ASSOCIATE (Forensics):** Hunts for earnings manipulation (Accruals vs. Cash Flow) and structural risks.
- **🏛️ PM (The "Edge"):** Synthesizes "Variant Perception"—identifying exactly where the market consensus is wrong.

## 🛠 Features

### 1. Full-Stack Financial Reconstruction
Unlike basic AI summarizers, Apex Capital AI reconstructs granular financial statements:

- **Balance Sheet:** Detailed working capital, PP&E, Goodwill, Debt tranches, and Equity.
- **Cash Flow:** Bridge from Net Income to Unlevered Free Cash Flow.

### 2. Alpha Generation Modules

- **Vibecode Sensitivity Matrix:** Quantifies a company's risk of "Cultural Obsolescence" due to AI shifts.

### 3. Generative Valuation
